# MinecraftBookGenerator
Creates a give command for a Minecraft written_book from an input file.

This Python script was originally written to automate the process of creating books for text files I had already created. It might not fit that purpose for you, but you are welcome to use it!

To use:
Run the script and follow the prompts.


Parts of the generate function are loosely based on TheWii's function that works similarly.
There are probably errors in this script. If you find any, make a bug report on the issues page.
